This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has fully mounted.  This is common in asynchronous operations where you're trying to update state based on a fetch call or other network request before the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method has executed.

```javascript
// Buggy component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    // Accessing this.state.data before it's populated will lead to errors.
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data ? this.state.data.name : 'Loading...'}</Text> 
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
